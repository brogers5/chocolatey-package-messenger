## Package Notes
Facebook hides Messenger downloads behind a timestamped download URL that is generated by a request to a canonical URL. While it seems possible to influence which software version is served (namely with `User-Agent` spoofing), the resulting URL is obfuscated and implements signature matching to prevent tampering, which makes reverse engineering of the server's behavior difficult. Therefore, this package will only support the latest available version, and should be treated similarly to packages with a non-versioned download URL.

This means the installer binary's checksum will periodically change, and a newly released software version will break this package version. Consequently, older package versions should generally be considered obsolete and unsupported.

Consider [internalizing this package](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/create/recompile-packages) if you require a stable binary, or the ability to install this specific version after a new version is released.
